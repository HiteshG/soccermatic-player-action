# soccermatic-player-action

For this assignment, the hand-in is just a pdf that you would show to the coach.
Make one pitch visual related to the actions of the player, and then one visual that compares them to the other relevant players in the competition. 
Just looking at their actions won't be enough for you to take any conclusions since you lack context to it.
